She graduated from law school at the University of South Dakota, then joined the United States Air Force Judge Advocate General’s Corps and spent 12 years on active duty, stationed in England, Korea, Italy, Texas and finally back in South Dakota. She has been involved in almost 100 trials as both a prosecutor and defense counsel and gained experience in international law, military operations law and government ethics. In 2011, the farm life beckoned, and Heather moved back to Mellette to get married and take over the family farm from her father. While some days she wishes she had an agronomy degree instead of a law degree, she is grateful for the many organizations, including the South Dakota Soybean Research and Promotion Council, that are available to help her become a better farmer.",Mellette,Heather Beaner,2024-06-30,Secretary,

Bruce believes in giving back to his community which has given his family so much. Bruce is involved in the SD Conservation Commission, South Dakota Nutrient Research and Education Council, Davison County Rural Water Board, Chairman of the Davison County Planning and Zoning Board, Davison County Conservation District, local Township board, and has held many other positions in his church. Bruce has 38 years of experience working outside the family farm business.

The American farmer is good at what we do, which means most Americans don’t need to worry about where their food comes from. Because the SDSRPC board is made up of farmers, we have first-hand knowledge of the work that goes into raising our quality product and can help get our story out.”",Wolsey,David Struck,2024-06-30,Chairman,
